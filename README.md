For start work with project on ur PC, download folder with textures from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18Z4IAHPUTvyNjDg6d-7MAyv_rsL_UTT7?usp=sharing and put it in folder with
compiled exe file(You need to open sln file and compile< in first time program throw exception< but after add teture folder this problem will be solved). ALso u need to have.NET Framework 4.8
